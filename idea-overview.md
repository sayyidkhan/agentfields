## 💡 Idea 1: MagiStock
**Persona-aware investment decision system with three competing strategy agents (Fire/Water/Grass) and a judge that picks based on user risk tolerance.**

---

## 🚗 Idea 3: WheelMagi
**Car purchase advisor with Thrill/Practical/Future agents that prevents buyer's remorse by stress-testing actual usage vs stated preferences.**

- **Category:** Consumer / Automotive
- **High-stakes decision:** $30-50k purchase with 5-10 year impact

## 📊 Idea 5: ToolMagi
**SaaS/software stack advisor with Integration/Simplicity/Cost agents for businesses choosing tools that fit team capability and scale.**

- **Category:** B2B / Software Procurement

## 🏢 Idea 6: SupplyMagi
**B2B vendor selection system with Cost/Quality/Relationship agents for supply chain decisions considering risk tolerance.**

- **Category:** B2B / Procurement
- **High-stakes decision:** Supplier relationships
- **Judge considers:** Volume needs, quality requirements, supply chain risk

---

## 👗 Idea 7: StyleMagi
**Context-aware fashion advisor with Classic/Statement/Versatile agents that prevents wardrobe regret by matching occasion, confidence, and existing wardrobe.**

- **Category:** Consumer / Fashion

## 🧠 Core Pattern: The Three Magi Framework

All ideas share:
- ✅ **3 specialized agents** with distinct perspectives
- ✅ **Self-critique** (agents acknowledge their bias)
- ✅ **Judge agent** that's context-aware, not just performance-optimizing
- ✅ **Persona alignment** (right for YOU, not just "best")
- ✅ **High-stakes decisions** (expensive mistakes, long time horizons)
- ✅ **Backend reasoning** (not chatbots)

---

## 📈 Alignment with Hackathon Criteria

| Criterion | All Ideas Score |
|-----------|----------------|
| **New problem space** | ✅ Decision engines, not chatbots |
| **Replaced complexity** | ✅ Eliminates consensus paralysis |
| **High leverage** | ✅ High-cost, high-regret domains |
| **Previously impossible** | ✅ Multi-agent reasoning with persona-awareness |

## 🏆 TOP 2 RECOMMENDATIONS

### 🥇 Option A: TechHR-Magi (Maximum Judge Credibility)

**Best if you want to WIN the hackathon**

**Strengths:**
- ✅ **Judge Appeal:** Every judge has hiring pain - instant credibility
- ✅ **B2B Value:** Perceived as "serious" business application
- ✅ **Clear ROI:** $100k+ hiring mistake prevention
- ✅ **Technical Feasibility:** Simple JSON data, no APIs needed
- ✅ **Demo Drama:** "Brilliant engineer vs team culture" = compelling

**Demo Narrative:**
"We hired for skills alone. He's brilliant but the team is miserable. This prevents that."

---

### 🥈 Option B: StyleMagi (Maximum Emotional Impact)

**Best if you want to CREATE BUZZ and stand out**

**Strengths:**
- ✅ **Emotional Resonance:** Everyone has fashion regret - universally relatable
- ✅ **Visual Demo:** Show actual outfits = more engaging than text
- ✅ **Unique Angle:** Only consumer app in likely sea of B2B demos

**Demo Narrative:**
"I bought it but never wore it. This prevents closet full of regret."

**Potential Risk:**

## 🤔 The Strategic Question

**TechHR-Magi** = Play it safe, optimize for judge credibility  
**StyleMagi** = Take a risk, optimize for memorability and emotional connection

**My gut:** TechHR-Magi wins, but StyleMagi gets invited to more demo days after
